This data analysis project aims to provide insights into how machine learning plays a role in making decisions in providing loans to customers. We will use Machine Learning with Python to facilitate the job of loan originators and predict whether candidate profiles are relevant or not using key features such as Status Marriage, Education, Applicant's Income, Credit History, etc.

- Jupyter NoteBook - Analysist and Report

EDA involved exploring the loan aproval to answer key questions, such as:

- What is the overall shows which value dominates ?
